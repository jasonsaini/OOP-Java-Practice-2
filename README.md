This is the second repo of Java practice where I continued learning object oriented design and unit testing, using How To Program Early Objects 11th edition.
I learned automating website templates, parsing JSON data, and using the map data structure to find word frequencies in a string!


My favorite exercises were:
- Website Generator - ex43
- Data Parser - ex42
- Word Frequency Finder - ex46
